# pipex

Pipex project is an introductory exercise at 42 school aimed at replicating the behavior of a UNIX pipeline. Students are tasked to create a program named pipex that takes two commands as arguments and executes them in the same way the shell would handle cmd1 | cmd2. It involves creating processes with fork, managing input and output redirections, using pipes for inter-process communication, and understanding the execution flow of commands in a shell environment. This project serves as a practical lesson in process creation and manipulation in C programming.
